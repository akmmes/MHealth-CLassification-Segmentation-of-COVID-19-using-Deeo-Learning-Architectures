## Project title
MHealth Classification and Segmentation of COVID-19 using Deep Learning Architectures

## Description
This research proposes a comprehensive comparison of deep learning models for CAD (Computer-Aided Design) systems which differentiates between COVID-19 and normal healthy lungs of CT & X-ray images using image classification and segment the radiological images of COVID-19 by using image segmentation.

 ## Features
My project aims to use deep learning techniques to detect COVID-19 in medical imaging such as CT scans and X-rays. The model was trained on a dataset of images from COVID-19 positive patients to learn the characteristic features of the disease in medical images. This allows for efficient and accurate detection of COVID-19 in medical imaging, which can assist in early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Additionally, the model can be used as a tool for radiologists and other medical professionals to help them quickly identify COVID-19 in patients.
